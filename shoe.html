<br><font color=ff0000><font face="tempus sans itc">Upon hearing Metallica's <i>One</i>, Hsien-Hsiu decided he was going
to play guitar and on his 15th birthday in 1990, he got one. Doodling around in high school, he attempted to form a band. In 1993, 
he got his first 7-string guitar. Graduating in 1994, he was already set to go to college at UT Austin. From 94-96, POA
was his band. In 1997, work began on putting together the band Drawn Under. Music should inspire. Always remembering his
formal teachings in jr high, and high orchestra, he still tries to maintain the spirit of rock'n'roll by just rocking out
and forgetting the rule book. Hsien-Hsiu joins the long list with Gwen Stefani and Tommy Lee, as marching band kids turned
rockers. "Music is universal, it speaks to the soul."

<br><font color=ffffff>"I've taken it upon myself to kind of use this as a launching pad to my own personal web page. What you will see is a documentary/journal of my thoughts on the
whole music thing. Hopefully those of you who read it will get an idea of the Austin metal scene and how one changes
with the band. What I also hope to accomplish is to have those that
have read it come away knowing something a little more than they normally would with a band. I think it's important for
fans to have that type of connection with the band. Enjoy" --Hsien-Hsiu </font>

<!-- <br><b> Hsien-Hsiu or "Shoe" as he is referred to, is the founding member of the band.&nbsp; He is from Missouri City, Texas and a graduate of Dulles High School.  He was previously in a band called Product of Aggression. He is currently in his fifth year at the University of Texas.
He jams on a seven string which gives Drawn Under it's crusty edge. -->
