<b>      Arising from within the deep depths of the superficial city of Sugar Land, Texas, is Metal 7-
string axe-slinger  Dean Dichoso.  A connoisseur of a vast array of musical styles and an avid 
player/performer of multiple musical instruments, Dean Dichoso pulls his "metal" influence for Drawn 
Under from several sources from Tool's haunting melodies to the thick meaty sounds of Napalm Death to 
the sweet low end growl of Korn to the grinding hardcore sounds of Cave-in.   
Having met Ken Liao when Dean's band (MondoZ – called "Daze" in 1994) played with Ken's 
old band (Turpentine Dream), they soon found mutual rock music interest.  Having become 
friends through the floating hubbub of the Houston local rock-scene, they finally started a band 
called "Styllborne" (1997) where Dean actually played Drums and Ken took the vocals.  Dean 
also currently performs in the "future-rock/metal" band MondoZ where he plays guitar, does 
vox, and plays synthesizers.   
        After Styllbourne had broken up due to Ken's graduation from high school, it was a matter of 
three years until Ken discovered that Dean had started going to the University of Texas working on a 
degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.  Dean, bored at the time, had asked Ken if he 
knew of any people that he could form a side-project with.  Ken, curious at the possibilities, told Dean to 
get a 7 string.  Dean already knew Hsien-Hsiu Liao from meeting at a Rush Concert in 1997 and the rest 
my fellow metal-heads, is history….. </b>
