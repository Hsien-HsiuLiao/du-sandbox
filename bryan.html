<br><font color=ff0000><b>Bryan comes straight out of the boonies of Kerrville, Texas.  As a 5th grader, he listened to Metallica’s Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth) - you know - “Bass solo take one” everyday before school, and idolized Lars Ulrich for his speed and sheer energy.  And so the seed was planted.  After finishing high school, he moved to Lubbock to go to Texas Tech University.  After realizing his mistake, he moved to Austin to go to the University of Texas and fulfill a lifelong dream of playing drums in a heavy metal band.  After taking lessons at the Woodshed Drum School for about 8 months, he hooked up with Hsien-Hsiu and then bassist Matt Moesker through a classified ad in the paper, and began to improve from playing heavy doses of old school favs like Metallica, Ozzy, and Megadeth.  He continued practicing rigorously through college, combining his old-school metal upbringing with new-school licks, drawing ideas from most all music styles.  He stands by his belief that as a musician, you have to remain open minded to all genres of music because they will be at least a subliminal form of influence.  He also believes it is never too late to start playing, and is living proof that it’s not.  He currently sits behind the kit as well for the Houston based MondoZ along with guitarist Dean, and is always searching for new sources of influence.</b>
