Ken lived in southwest Houston, in a suburb called Missouri City for most of his life.  In high school, after playing bass for a few years, Ken joined a band called Turpentine Dream.  The band lasted for about three years(1994-97) and within that time they played in various Houston clubs like The Abyss, Fitzgerald's and Deep Phat.  In that time, Ken met a band called Daze which had future guitarist of Drawn Under, Dean, in the band.  As Turpentine Dream parted ways, Ken decided to sing in a band and went through a few lineup changes in his new band Styllborne.  He met up with Dean, who played drums for Styllborne and found two other guys to play and they played shows in Houston for about a year(1997).  
	After Ken graduated in May 1997 he moved to Austin in August 1997 to attend UT and Styllborne fell apart for various reasons.  He met up with his brother Hsien-Hsiu, who was already at UT and had a band going.  In September of that year, Hsien-Hsiu's bassist left the band and Ken joined in to take his place.  About a year and a half of paintstakingly looking for a singer went by before Drawn Under started to play out in Austin.  In February of 1999, after finally finding a singer who was willing to stick around, Drawn Under played their first show. In June, when Dean moved up to Austin to also attend UT, Ken had wanted him to sing for the band and to get rid of their original singer.  Dean declined so he could focus on school.  The original singer was then kicked out of the band in July of 1999 and Ken took over as vocalist while still being bassist.  Then in August 1999, Dean, wanting to play guitar in a band rather than sing wanted to know if Drawn Under could use a second guitarist.  In September, Dean was added into the band and completed the lineup.
